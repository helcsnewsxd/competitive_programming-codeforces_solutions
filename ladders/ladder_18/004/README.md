# Anton and Letters

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/443/A), the solution is implementing the parsing algorithm to count the quantity of different letters.
Therefore, the best idea is to use Python to code it because the built-in functions are very useful to do that.

The code can be found [here](./solution.py).
