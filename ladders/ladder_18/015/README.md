# Pashmak and Garden

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/459/problem/A), the solution is simply calculate the points of the square knowing that all the sides have equal size.
One thing to notice is that if the points doesn't share a coordinate, then the square is full defined. However, if they share a coordinate, I choose the square of size $1$.

The code can be found [here](./solution.cpp).
