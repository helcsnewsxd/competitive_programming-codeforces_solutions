# Fox And Snake

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/510/A), the solution is simply implementing the constructive algorithm to write the snake (even rows are full snake body and odd rows only have one character with a part of snake).

The code can be found [here](./solution.cpp).
