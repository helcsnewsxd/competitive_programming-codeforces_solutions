# Caisa and Sugar

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/463/A), the solution is calculate the quantity of sweets that Caisa can receive and return the maximum of them.
Notice that the only values that are important are the values that Caisa can pay.
Also, if cents are different to zero, I consider one dollar more to pay for Caisa.
And if cents are zero, Caisa doesn't receive sweets. Otherwise, the quantity is $100-y$.

The code can be found [here](./solution.cpp).
