# Flipping Game

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/327/A), the solution is to calculate the number of ones after all the possible changes. Then, the solution is the maximum of them.
I can do that because $n=100$ and the complexity is $O(n^2)$.

The code can be found [here](./solution.cpp).
