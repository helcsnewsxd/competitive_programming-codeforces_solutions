# inc ARG

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/465/A), the solution is very simply because we only have to count the quantity of consecutive bits on in the prefix plus one.
The only thing that we've to notice is that the result has to be the minimum between the last quantity and the number of bits.

The code can be found [here](./solution.cpp).
