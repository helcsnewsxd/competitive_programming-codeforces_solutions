# I Wanna Be the Guy

In this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/469/A), the solution is very simply because I've to have an array with $n$ values false and mark as true if a level can be pass for $X$ or $Y$.
If all the levels are true, then they can pass the $n$ levels. However, if anyone is false, it's impossible.

The code can be found [here](./solution.cpp).
