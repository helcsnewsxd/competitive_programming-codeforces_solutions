# Codeforces solutions

The present repository contains solutions of Codeforces problems. The solutions will be complete and will have a good detail about the idea of how it's solved.

In the repository, I divide the problems in different categories according to whether they're part of a ladder ([site](https://a2oj.netlify.app/ladders)), of a division contest or of a gym contest, for example.

## Index

To be more clear in the organization of the repository, I use indexes to link the corresponding folders and files. This helps me a lot to move easily and fast across all the files.

- [Ladders](./ladders/)
  - [Ladder 18 (1900 - 1999)](./ladders/ladder_18/)
